.TH WIGTOAD 1
.SH NAME
wigtoad \- WherIGo download tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
.B wigtoad \fI[options]\fR [\fI[cartridge]\fR]
.SH NOTE
If WigToad was not installed from a (distribution-specific) package
(like .rpm for RedHat, OpenSuse, CentOS and derivatives; .deb for Debian
and Ubuntu, etc.), it may be necessary to invoke WigToad with the
.B .rb
suffix, as in \fBwigtoad.rb\fR, \fB./wigtoad.rb\fR, \fBruby wigtoad.rb\fR
or even \fBruby1.9.3 wigtoad.rb\fR
(if the \fBruby\fR in your PATH is not the one you want to use).
'
'In a Windows environment, when not using the installer, create a desktop
'link - using a terminal is highly recommended.
.SH DESCRIPTION
WigToad is software to help speed up the boring part of WherIGo'ing:
downloading the (latest) cartridge version for the right device(s).
.P
Where multiple entries are possible (e.g. for device type, cartridge GUID,
or input file), marked by \fB(MULTI)\fR below),
they can be delimited by a pipe symbol (\fB|\fR) or a colon (\fB:\fR),
or you can define your own delimiter(s).
Make sure the pipe symbols are properly escaped from the command shell!
.P
.B Important:
To use this software, you must have agreed with the terms of service on wherigo.com
as you have to accept their EULA. WigToad will not do this for you!
.SH OPTIONS
Option keywords are case-sensitive, and may be separated from values by whitespace
or an equal sign \fB=\fR.
Options can be unambiguously abbreviated, for example, \fB--password\fR may be written
as \fB--pas\fR (but not \fB--p\fR).
.TP
\fB-h\fR|\fB--help\fR
get a short command-line option summary
.TP
\fB-v\fR|\fB--verbose\fR|\fB--debug\fR
enable debugging output - very helpful in case of malfunctions.
Multiple \fB-v\fR options raise the debug level, resulting in copious output.
.TP
\fB-u\fR|\fB--user\fR|\fB--username\fR \fIusername\fR
geocaching.com/wherigo.com username (required)
.TP
\fB-p\fR|\fB--password\fR \fIpassword\fR
geocaching.com/wherigo.com password (required)
.TP
\fB-m\fR|\fB--delimiter\fR \fIdelimiter(s)\fR
delimiter(s) to be used for \fB(MULTI)\fR input, default "|:"

The TUI uses "|".
You may try "^" to avoid delimiters that have to be "escaped" ("quoted").
.TP
\fB-o\fR|\fB--output\fR \fIpath\fR
output file path (default: automatic)
.TP
\fB-t\fR|\fB--type\fR|\fB--devicetype\fR \fIdevicetype\fR
\fB(MULTI)\fR
device type(s) (known: colorado, pocketpc, oregon, nuvi; default: colorado)
.TP
\fB-F\fR|\fB--file\fR|\fB--fromFile\fR
read cartridge GUIDs from file (see PARAMETERS below for details)
.TP
\fB-Z\fR|\fB--preserveCache\fR|\fB--keepOld\fR
do not overwrite existing files in file cache
.TP
\fB-O\fR|\fB--overwriteExisting\fR
overwrite existing cartridge files (should not be necessary)
.TP
\fB-P\fR|\fB--proxy\fR \fIproxy\fR
HTTP proxy server, http://username@password@host:port/
.TP
\fB-C\fR|\fB--clearCache\fR|\fB--cleanup\fR
selectively clear browser cache
.SH PARAMETERS \fB(MULTI)\fR
You may list cartridge GUIDs as parameters, even prefixed with a
(usually GC) code and an equal sign:
.PP
GC2PN9A=1b93d504-278a-4edf-b609-53497cac06dd
will create output files GC2PN9A-....gwc
.PP
1b93d504-278a-4edf-b609-53497cac06dd
will use a hash of H6DGDBE to form H6DGDBE-....gwc filenames.
.PP
Of course you may list multiple entries, using a \fB:\fR delimiter.
Input files have precedence over parameter arguments.
.SH SPECIAL CASES
If
.B user
or
.B owner
names contain special (non-ASCII) characters, and you are using Windows,
you may not be able to login or run a "user" query.
In those cases, you'll have to pre-encode those characters.
.B http://www.utf8-chartable.de/unicode-utf8-table.pl?number=1024
will help you to look up the proper UTF-8 codes.
Prefix each two-digit hex value with a percent sign, for example:
.B (capital_letter_O_with_diaeresis)lscheich
will become
.B %c3%96lscheich
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B WIG_DIR
If set, WigToad will put its cache in this directory. If not the cache is
placed in ~/.wigtoad/ . Note that it is not secure to set WIG_DIR to point
to a world-writable directory such as /tmp.
.TP
.B LANG
To properly handle special characters (which are not in the ASCII character
set, such as umlauts, etc.) we recommend to set
.B LANG
to
.B en_US.UTF-8
or similar. The syntax depends on the shell you're using:
 
.B setenv LANG en_US.UTF-8
for C-shell derivatives (csh, tcsh)
 
.B LANG=en_US.UTF-8; export LANG
for Bourne and Korn shell (sh, ksh)
 
.B export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
for Bourne Again shell and derivatives (bash, dash)
